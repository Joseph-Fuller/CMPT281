		<h1>A Brief History</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><h2>Early Years</h2>
				<p>
				Joseph Alex Fuller was born July 19, 1996 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He 
				grew up in a house in the north end of the city with his parents, brother, and a
				dog named Jake. Joseph went to school from kindergarden to Grade 8 at Sister
				O'Brien school, where he attended the French immersion program offered there. 
				Around this time, he also started taking piano lessons, which he continued to take 
				until his sophomore year of high school.
				Although he continued to enroll in the immersion program at Bishop James Mahoney 
				high school, Joseph cannot recall a single instance where his additional language 
				skills have had a practical benefit. While attending high school, Joseph acquired 
				an interest in music and music production while playing in BJM's concert band, 
				where he played trombone. During this time, he also worked as a merchandise clerk
				for a now-defunct chain of grocery stores. Overall, this proved to be a tedious yet
				character-building exercise in discipline.

			<li><h2>Continuing Education</h2>
				<p>
				After graduation, he enrolled in the Media Arts Production program at Saskatchewan
				Polytechnic (formerly SIAST). This program, only being offered at the institute's 
				Woodland campus, necessitated a move to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. This would be
				Joseph's first time living on his own. He enjoyed the independence despite the 
				conditions in which it was experienced. Prince Albert isn't a great place for
				young people. The course Joseph was attending also came with its own mixed merits.
				It became obvious that it ws the product of a bygone era; still looking at digital 
				media as a novelty. This proved to be in contrast
				with the realities of the industry, and the program seemed to lag behind by several
				years. Nevertheless, Joseph managed to secure a job at a Saskatoon-based live-events
				production company upon completing his 8 month certificate.

				The production company proved to be an interesting introduction to the realm of 
				full-time employment and an education of its own kind. Over an 18 month period,
				Joseph learned a great deal about the world of entertainment and the people who
				occupy it. Working with a team under tough conditions proved 
				to be immensely satisfying: overcoming obstacles and solving problems really brings
				people together. Unfortunately the management structure of the company began to 
				wear on him and ultimately proved psychologically draining. As much as he had hoped
				to continue in the industry, he decided to leave and continue his education.

			<li><h2>Future</h2>
				<p>
				This is where we find Joseph Fuller today: starting his second full semester at 
				the U of S. Resilient and hopeful for a future in an industry in which he 
				can progress. Believing in a better tomorrow and working to make it happen.
